# Problems
This is the default repository for Frostburg State University's computer club.

This repository hold minutes, problems, and solutions for each meeting.

The current format is as follows: 
* Purposed minutes as a docX to be added before club.
* A readme containing all links and material for the meeting (to be uploaded before the meeting.)
* A PDF following the meeting for ease of viewing by anyone who is viewing this repository.
