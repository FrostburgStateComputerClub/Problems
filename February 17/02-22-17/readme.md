January 22nd meeting



This meeting we will focus on a few problems broken up by skill such that students of all levels can participate and learn. For the sake of breaking things up into an organized manner, I will rank each question by difficulty. However, do not let it discourage you from exploring problems outside of your comfort zone (failing is how you learn!)


EVERYONE!
